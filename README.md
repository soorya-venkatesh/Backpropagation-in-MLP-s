# Backpropagation-in-MLP-s\
Implemented Forward and Backword propagation for a computational graph.Also used gradient checking to ensure backpropagation is implemented correctly.
After obtaining weights and corresponding gradients utilized following optimisers to resduce loss\
1. Vannila gradient descent
2. Momentum based SGD
2. Adam
